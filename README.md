Thought it would end with just one form? 👀

We have a bonus for you! 😍 💜
We know how much our students enjoy recreating a layout, so we have <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/fnZyJHs7eqNFAA7tUrKcsD/Stage-03---Formul%C3%A1rio-avan%C3%A7ado/duplicate" target="blank">**another one here** </a>.
By clicking the link, you'll find another form option, a bit more complex than the previous one.

In this, we'll cover:

- Select field;
- Checkbox field;
- Image centered in the header.

It's important to note: feel free to change the colors, add more fields, stylize it your way, okay? 💜
